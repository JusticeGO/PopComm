Description: Facilitates population-level analysis of ligand-receptor interactions 
    using large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data. Identifies significant LR pairs 
    and quantifies their interactions through correlation-based filtering and projection score 
    computations. Designed for large-sample single-cell studies, the package employs 
    statistical modeling, including linear regression, to investigate LR relationships 
    between cell types. It provides a systematic framework for understanding cell-cell 
    communication, uncovering regulatory interactions and signaling mechanisms. 
    Future updates will enhance visualization and downstream analyses for improved biological interpretation.
